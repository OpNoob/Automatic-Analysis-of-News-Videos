# Automatic Analysis of News Videos
My Final Year Project (FYP) for my degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Hons) at the University of Malta. This project extracts individual occurrences from TVM news videos in order to combat visual biases in news.

An executable is also provided without any necessary installations.

# Development and Testing
Currently no further development will be done due to the FYP submission.

For the full list of code during development, validation, analysis compairson and results, access the [development_tests](https://github.com/OpNoob/Automatic-Analysis-of-News-Videos/tree/development_tests) branch.

The [main](https://github.com/OpNoob/Automatic-Analysis-of-News-Videos/tree/main) branch contains only the code for the program up till creating and executable.
